Hello, everyone! I’ve been around the tech scene for quite some time, yet here I am finally offering a proper greeting on my personal site. It might seem like I’m late to the party with a “Hello world,” but I think it’s still a fitting way to kick off something new.

## Revamping the Portfolio
I’m focusing on giving my personal website some well-deserved attention, particularly the **portfolio** section. I plan on showcasing the recent projects I’ve worked on, because I believe these highlights can be just as—if not more—important than a traditional résumé.

## Embracing Open Source

I also want to become more involved in the **open-source** community. Gradually, I’ll make parts of my site’s code available so other developers can clone it and build their own personal websites. My hope is that, by doing this, we can collaborate, learn from each other, and strengthen the developer community.

## What’s Next
Stay tuned for more updates! Soon, I’ll share additional details about my recent projects and the improvements I’m making to this site’s code. I’m looking forward to a fresh phase of sharing knowledge and fostering collaborations.

Thank you for stopping by, and see you next time!
