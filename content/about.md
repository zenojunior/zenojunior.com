## Work

I currently work at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/swordhealth">SWORD Health</a>, whose mission is to free the world from pain.

## Offline

When I'm not coding, I enjoy play multiplayer games and discovering news technology projects (or trying build something).

I have recently graduated from Universidade do Vale do Taquari (University) and am now officially a software engineer.

Listening a good sound while I code is awesome. There are my favorite bands:
<a href="https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCXv6UMItAxIebYSLqsfcXnQ" target="_blank">DROELOE</a> (to code),
<a href="https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCOlopik2E2HUHaWlktS0QmA" target="_blank">Tom Walker</a> (to relax).
